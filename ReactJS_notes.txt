React:
	is a JS library for building UI => created by Facebook.
	properties and state
	parent-child relationships
	component lifecycle
	does not require Node.js to work, but will use npm (node package manager)
	npm => makes the process of building fullstack
		applications with Reach much simpler.

	open source project
	to make single page applications
	another exciting feature is virtual DOM
	functional programming
	immutability
	commonly used in enterprise applications
	
Why React is so fast?
	JS objects are faster than DOM objects.
	React Virtual DOM is a JS object
	Never reads from the real DOM
	
React Syntax:
	add react library from facebook git-hub page
	copy the script code and paste it in html
	then in body:
		have a script tag which will have all of the react content.
		will contain a a function called ReactDOM.render
	ReactDOM.render():
			takes 2 arguments:
			first what we want to create
			second where we want to put it.
			

	Ex:
		ReactDOM.render(
			React.createElement('div',null,'Hello World'),
			document.getElementById('react-container'))
		react-container => is an id with div 

JSX: stands for Javascript for XML
	instead of creating all these createElement function class,
	we will use tags over here.
	Ex : => unordered list
	Babble => will take the JSX and turn into createElement call, so the browser can read it easily.
		is a transpiler that will transpiler JS code.
		works for JSX
		works for ES6 and beyond
		install babel from the babbel site and put it in the HTML => CDN, put it in another script tag
		
	everytime we add babel=> we need to add <script type='text/babel'></script>

React Components:
	components are small user interface elements that display data as it changes over time.
	then these components are composed together, nested inside of one another to create entire unser interfaces.
