Information Architecture: Structual design of a website navigation
DOM: Descirbe the structure of the page
JS: the language responsible for managing interaction with in a browser.
	interacts with the DOM handling events
	loading and unloading media
	creating, modifying and delete elements in a page
Server: in charge of managing the interaction between data nad how the data is presented to the user
Compiled Languages: C, C++, Objective-C
Interpreted: PHP, JS
Hydrid: Java, C#, VB.NET, Python
JS: interpreted Language
	Case sensitive
	create a variable => var variable name;
	weakly typed language
	String properties => .length
	operators => alert(), prompt(){taking inputs}
	= assignment, == equlaity, === strict equality
	functions => function function_name () {}
	Number() => JS built in function to make a variable a number
	isNaN() => not a number
	String has methods:
			.toUpperCase();
			.toLowerCase();
			.indexOf();
			.slice(2arguments);
			.substring(), .substr();
			
	Regular Expression: format of a string
			match patterns and strings
		2 parts:
			create expression
			Apply and ask if it matches
		
		var myRE = /hello/; var myRE = new RegExp ("hello");
		functions for regular expressions
				.test()
		creating patterns:
			var myRE = /^hello/; or /hello$/; or /hel+o/ => + once or more,  ^ at the start , $ at the end
	Arrays:
		 0 based index
		var array_name = [];
		var arrya_name = ['','',''];
		methods are functions that belong to an object
		Array Methods
			.reverse(), .sort(), .join(), .pop(), .push(), .length
		
	Events Names:
		onload, onclick, onmouseover, onblur,onfocus
	Handling Events:
		element.event = function () { }; => no need for function name  		
	
	
	Class:
		blue print, an idea, description
		defines attributes and behaviors.	
	Object:
		is created from teh class
	Encapsulation:
		the idea that classes are self-contianed units that represent both the data and the code that works on that data

	Multithreading: doing multiple things inside one program and this is multithreading.
		you often do to keep your program responsive 


UX for Web Designers:
	Standard Design: using elements the same way that major sites do
	
UX Foundations: Accessibility:
	Accessibility: people with different disability can use our content
