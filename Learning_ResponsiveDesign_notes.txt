Responsive Design:
	is a design strategy that is centered on designing your content so that
	it responds to the envirnoment. 

	1.Fluid Grids => for flexible layouts
	2.media Queries => adapt content to specific screen sizes
	3.flexible image and media => responds to changes in screen sizes as well.

Controlling Viewports:
	2 mechanisms : overriding the user agent's default viewport
	-viewport meta tag
		in head => <meta name="viewport" content="width=480, initial-scale=1">
	
	-@viewport CSS rule
		in CSS => @viewport { width:480px; zoom:1;}
	initial scale => controls the zoom factor of your content for the initial view of the page.
	
Hardware Pixels:
	smallest points the screen can display, 
Reference pixels:
	sometime called CSS pixel
	a unit of measurement that establishes an optical standard for the length of a pixel, and is totally independent of hardware pixels
	
Reduce bitmap graphics:
	svg and CSS7

Media Queries:
	<link rel="" href=""type="" media="screen">
	available media types:
		braille, projection, print, handheld.	
	
	<link rel="" href="" media="screnn adn (min-width:480px)">
	
	syntax:
		@media[not|only] screen [and](expression){
		}

	media = "screen and (min-width:480px), screen and (orientation:landscape)"
	, => OR operator

Media Features:
	width*, height*, device-width*, device-height, orientation
	aspect_ratio*, device-aspect ratio, color, color index*
	monochrome*, resolution, scan, grid
	
	*accepts 'min-' and 'max-' prefixes
	
	if creating modular style sheet and bring the external sheet use:
			@import url(example.css) screen and (max-width:480 px);

BreakPoint:
	the moment a layout changes from one layout to another. Usually triggered by the width of the view port.

Using fluid grids: (grid System)
	16px grid => default
